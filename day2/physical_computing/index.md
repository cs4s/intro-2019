# Physical Computing with BBC Micro:bits

## About

In this session you will learn about *Physical Computing* by creating a variety of different projects that run on *BBC Micro:bit* devices. *Physical Computing* usually refers to designing and developing computer hardware and software that involves some physical interaction or the use of sensors. This physical interaction could be a different way of interacting with the computer, which may not involve using a mouse and keyboard.

In this session we will focus on making programs that involve alternative forms of physical interaction (i.e. not using a keyboard and mouse).

You may have heard of [Arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc/){:target="_blank"} or [Rasbperry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/){:target="_blank"}. These are both small and cheap computers that can be used in a variety of *Physical Computing* projects. We will use *Micro:bits* in this session's activities, which you could say are a simpler version of these devices.

In this session's activities, you will create a variety of programs that run on *Micro:bit* devices by Coding projects in *Microsoft's MakeCode*. *MakeCode* is an example of a *Hybrid Coding Environment*, like *Pencil Code*, which allows you to switch between *Blocks* and *Text* Coding (using *JavaScript*). There are other options for Coding projects on *Micro:bits*, which allow you to use *Python* (another *Text* language), but we will focus on using *MakeCode* today. 

When Coding the projects in *MakeCode* and running them on the *Micro:bit* devices, you will apply several of the **computational concepts** that you have learned about in the other workshop sessions, such as: *Sequences*, *Loops*, *Events* and *Operators*. You will also learn about and apply two new **computational concepts**: *Data* and *Conditionals*.

#### Computational Concepts

| Computational Concept   | How the Concept is Addressed in the Session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sequences               | In this session, you will use *Sequences* of instructions when creating programs in *Microsoft's MakeCode* that will run on the *Micro:bits*. For example, in the *Making an Interactive Badge* activity you will create a *Sequence* of instructions to make the display light up different LEDs.                                                            |
| Loops                   | In this session, you will use *Loops* to make the *Micro:bit* repeat instructions multiple times. For example, in the *Making an Interactive Badge* activity you will use the *repeat* block in *Microsoft's MakeCode* to make the LEDs on the *Micro:bit's* display change between 2 patterns repeatedly.                                                    |
| Events                  | In this session, you will use *Events* to make the *Micro:bit* to follow instructions after a certain event. For example, in the *Making an Interactive Badge* activity you will have commands that are followed after the two buttons on the *Micro:bit* are pressed together.                                                                               |
| Conditionals            | In this session, you will use *Conditionals* to make the *Micro:bit* to follow different instructions based on different conditions. For example, in the *Using Different Inputs* activity you will use *if* blocks to make the *Micro:bit* show different letters on the LED display (N, S, E or W) depending on the direction that the compass is pointing. |
| Data                    | In this session, you will use *Data* to store and update *variables* on the *Micro:bit*. For example, in the *Using Different Inputs* activity you will use the *set* block to store the measurement of the light level in a *variable*.                                                                                                                      |
| Operators               | In this session, you will use *Operators* to make the *Micro:bit* choose and compare numbers. For example, in the *Using Different Inputs* activity you will use the *pick random* block to make the *Micro:bit* choose a random number between 0 and 5, as part of creating a dice project.                                                                  |

#### Computational Practices

| Computational Practice          | How this Practice is Addressed in the Session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|:--------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Being incremental and iterative | In this session, you will have the opportunity to practice *being incremental and iterative* when Coding. For example, when you create the compass project in the *Using Different Inputs* activity, you will build the project up one part at a time.                                                                              |
| Testing and debugging           | In this session you will have the opportunity to practice *testing and debugging* when Coding. For example, when completing the *Making an Interactive Badge* and *Using Different Inputs* activities, you may test the programs that you created in *Microsoft's MakeCode's* emulator before transferring them to the *Micro:bit*. |

For example, if you complete the *Making an Interactive Badge* and *Using Different Inputs* activities quickly, you may want to come up with an idea and implement it in *Microsoft's MakeCode*. |
| Questioning                 | In this session, you will learn about how you can use *Physical Computing* devices (such as *Micro:bits*) to help students invent creative ways of investigating and analysing problems.                                                                                                  |
