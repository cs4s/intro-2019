# Moving From Blocks to Text Coding

## About

In this session, you will learn about:

- The differences between *Blocks*, *Hybrid* and *Text Coding Environments*
- Why you might choose one of these types of *Coding Environments* for teaching Coding to your students
- How *Hybrid Coding Environments* can be used to help students (particularly those that are in Years 7-8) move from *Blocks* to *Text* Coding, 
- Examples of different *Blocks*, *Hybrid* and *Text Coding Environments* that are freely available and that can be used for a variety of purposes (for example, music composition or creating art)

After a presentation that explains the differences between *Blocks languages* to *Text languages*, there will be an activity where you use [Pencil Code](http://pencilcode.net/){:target="_blank"} to draw different patterns and shapes with Code.
[Pencil Code](http://pencilcode.net/){:target="_blank"} is an example of a *Hybrid Coding Environment*, which allows you to switch between *Blocks* and *Text* modes.
Consequently, *Pencil Code* could be a useful tool to use for helping students move from *Blocks* to *Text* Coding, or for differentiating instruction in your lessons.

In this session's activities you will apply two of the **Computational Concepts** that you learned about yesterday (*Sequences* and *Loops*), as well as some Mathematics concepts, to command a Turtle Sprite in *Pencil Code* to draw Art.
You will also learn about another **Computational Concept** called *Operators*.
*Operators* can be used for a variety of purposes, such as the *random* block that you will use in the activity to move the Turtle Sprite to random positions on the Canvas.

#### Computational Concepts

| Computational Concept   | How the Concept is Addressed in the Session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sequences               | When drawing Art with *Pencil Code* in this session, you will create *Sequences* of instructions for the Turtle to follow. For example, in the *Drawing a Sky Full of Stars* activity you will create *Sequences* of *fd* and *dot* commands that will cause the Turtle to draw in different spots on the Canvas.                                  |
| Loops                   | When drawing Art with *Pencil Code* in this session, you will use *Loops* to make the Turtle repeat certain steps. For example, in the *Drawing a Sky Full of Stars* activity you will use the *for* block, along with the *fd* and *dot* commands, when drawing patterns on the Canvas.                                                          |
| Operators               | When drawing Art with *Pencil Code* in this session, you will learn about different *Operators* blocks. For example, in the *Drawing a Sky Full of Stars* activity, you will use the *random* block,  with the *moveto* and *dot* blocks, to draw randomly sized dots in random positions on the Canvas, in order to create a starry night scene. |

#### Computational Practices

| Computational Practice          | How this Practice is Addressed in the Session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|:--------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Being incremental and iterative | You will be *incremental and iterative* when creating blocks of commands for drawing Art in *Pencil Code*. For example, in the *Creating Dot Paintings* activity you will build up a stack of blocks iteratively (one part at a time).                                                                                                                                                              |
| Testing and debugging           | You will test and debug (fix problems in your Code) during the session's activities. For example, when creating your code for the *Creating Dot Paintings* activity you may find that the code does not work as you expected. The process of checking that the code works as expected is called *Testing* and the process of identifying and fixing code that does not work is called *Debugging*. |

| 2.6.2: Use effective teaching strategies to integrate ICT into learning and teaching programs to make selected content relevant and meaningful | In this session you will learn about using *Pencil Code* when integrating ICT (specifically Coding) into learning and teaching. For example, in the session's presentation you will learn about different educational *Coding environments* that are available and how these could cater to students' different interests. One example of these *Coding environments* is *Sonic Pi*, which is a *Coding environment* that allows you to compose music through code. Another example of these *Coding environments* is *Processing*, which is a tool for learning how to code within the context of the Visual Arts. |
| 3.3.2: Select and use relevant teaching strategies to develop knowledge, skills, problem solving and critical and creative thinking.           | In this session you will learn about ways to help develop students' critical and creative thinking when Coding. For example, in the *Creating Dot Paintings* activity, you will be encouraged to be creative when you draw different patterns by writing commands for the Turtle in *Pencil Code* to follow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3.4.2: Select and/or create and use a range of resources, including ICT, to engage students in their learning.                                 | In this session you will have the opportunity to use a range of resources that have been developed to assist the teaching of Coding to students at the various Stages of K-12. The focus of the resources that will be presented are those that can assist students moving from *Blocks* (*Visual Programming*) to *Text* (*General-Purpose Programming*) languages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 6.2.2: Participate in learning to update knowledge and practice, targeted to professional needs and school and/or system priorities.           | In this session you will be given some examples of how Coding and Computational Thinking can be incorporated into different areas of the curriculum and STEM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 6.4.2: Undertake professional learning programs designed to address identified student learning needs.                                         | In this session you will learn about *Hybrid Coding Environments*, which could help you differentiate activities when teaching lessons that involve Coding. For example, if you were using *Pencil Code* for an activity, you could suggest students that are confident Coders to complete the activities using the *Text* mode only and suggest that the rest of the class to use the *Blocks* mode (or switch between *Text* and *Blocks* modes appropriately).                                                                                                                                                    |

| Numeracy Element                                 | How this Element is Addressed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Estimating and calculating with whole numbers    | You will calculate with whole numbers when you complete the session's activities in *Pencil Code*. For example, you will calculate with whole numbers when commanding the Turtle to move around the Stage with the *fd* and *rt* blocks in the *Creating Dot Paintings* activity.                                                                                                       |
| Recognising and using patterns and relationships | You will recognise and use a variety of patterns during the session's activities, when commanding the Turtle to draw Art in *Pencil Code*. For example, you will have to recognise and use the relationship between the number of turns that the Turtle makes, the dots that it draws on the Canvas and the degrees that the Turtle turns, in order to draw a circular pattern of dots. |
| Using spatial reasoning                          | You will have the opportunity to use spatial reasoning when drawing Art with *Pencil Code* in the session's activities. For example, you will use some of the blocks in the *Move* section of blocks in *PencilCode*, which can be used to change the position of the Turtle on the Stage (a Cartesian plane).                                                                         |

####  Critical and Creative Thinking

| Critical and Creative Thinking Element      | How this Element is Addressed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Generating ideas, possibilities and actions | You will generate a variety of ideas, possibilities and actions when completing the session's activities. For example, there are multiple ways to draw the patterns and images in the *Drawing a Sky Full of Stars* and *Creating Dot Paintings* activities. Each of these different ways will cause the Turtle in *Pencil Code* to draw very different results.  |
| Reflecting on thinking and processes        | In the session's activities you will have the opportunity to reflect on the approaches that you used to create the different projects. You will also have the opportunity to view the projects that other workshop participants and *Pencil Code* community members have made and reflect on how the processes used to create those projects differed from yours. |

####  Information and Communication Technology Capability

| Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Element   | How this Element is Addressed                                                                                                                              |
