# Lesson Planning

## About

In this activity you will work in groups to plan a lesson that addresses outcomes from the *NSW Science and Technology K-6* and *Technology Mandatory Years 7-8* syllabuses.
You can choose to use any of the approaches and technologies that we have introduced over the last two days, or a particular technology that your school has access to, for this lesson. 
For example, you can create a lesson that involves students creating projects *Scratch* or that uses an *Unplugged* approach.

We can help you with any questions you have about the curriculum, mapping these activities to the NSW syllabuses or the technologies that you plan to use during the activity. 
At the end of the session the lesson plans that have been created will be shared and discussed with the other groups.

#### Computational Concepts

| Computational Concept   | How the Concept is Addressed in the Session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sequences               | You may include the teaching of *Sequences* in the lesson plan that you create in this session. For example, you may include the *My Robotic Friends* activity in your lesson, which will demonstrate the importance of the order and preciseness of instructions when creating algorithms for computers to follow.                                                                           |
| Loops                   | You may include the teaching of *Loops* in the lesson plan that you create in this session. For example, if you are using *Scratch* when teaching Coding in your lesson, then you may show students *Scratch's* *repeat* block, which will cause a Sprite to follow commands over and over again.                                                                                             |
| Parallelism             | You may include the teaching of *Parallelism* in the lesson plan that you create in this session. For example, if you are using *Scratch* when teaching Coding in your lesson, then you may include an activity where two or more Sprites are following commands at the same time.                                                                                                            |
| Events                  | You may include the teaching of *Events* in the lesson plan that you create in this session. For example, if you are using *Micro:bits* when teaching Coding in your lesson, then you may ask your students to create a project where the *Micro:bit* plays a tone when one of the buttons are pressed.                                                                                       |
| Conditionals            | You may include the teaching of *Conditionals* in the lesson plan that you create in this session. For example, if you are using *Micro:bits* when teaching Coding in your lesson, then you may ask your students to create a project where the *Micro:bit* plays a tone on a certain condition (such as when the acceleration measured by the *Micro:bit* is greater than a certain amount). |
| Data                    | You may include the teaching of *Data* in the lesson plan that you create in this session. For example, you could include the *Binary Numbers* activity from the *Computer Science Unplugged* resources in your lesson. The *Binary Numbers* activity could help your students understand how data is represented in various forms on computers.                                              |
| Operators               | You may include the teaching of *Operators* in the lesson plan that you create in this session. For example, if you are using *Pencil Code* when teaching Coding in your lesson, you may suggest that students use the *random* block from the *Operators* section to make the Turtle draw shapes in random positions of the Canvas.                                                          |

#### Computational Practices

| Computational Practice          | How this Practice is Addressed in the Session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|:--------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Being incremental and iterative | You may have activities in the lesson plan that include opportunities for your students to be *incremental and iterative* when Coding. For example, if you are using *Scratch* for teaching Coding, you may have an activity where students build up a large project iteratively (one part at a time).                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Testing and debugging           | You may include activities where students have to engage in *testing and debugging* code in the lesson plan that you create in this session. For example, if you are using *Scratch* for teaching Coding, you may ask students to identify and fix bugs in the *Scratch Debug It* projects (which you learned about on Day 1 of the workshop).                                                                                                                         |
| Reusing and remixing            | You may include activities where students have the opportunity to engage in the *reusing and remixing* of existing projects in the lesson plan that you create in this session. For example, if you are using *Scratch* for teaching Coding, you may ask students to remix some projects that members of the *Scratch* community have made and make some changes to their remixed copy.                                                                                |
| Abstracting and modularising    | You may include activities where students have the opportunity to engage in *abstracting and modularising* when Coding. For example, if you are using *Scratch* when teaching Coding, you may ask students to create custom blocks that combine common instructions into one block. Alternatively, if you are using *Pencil Code* when teaching Coding, you may create *functions* that perform common instructions (for example, drawing a circular pattern of dots). |

#### Computational Perspectives

| Computational Perspective   | How this Perspective is Addressed in the Session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|:-------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Expressing               | You may include activities where students can use Coding for personal and creative expression in the lesson plan that you create in the session. For example, if you are using *Pencil Code* when teaching Coding, you could ask students to draw a scene with the Turtle that is related to the students' interests (such as a Beach or Mountain scene).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Connecting               | You may include opportunities for your students to connect and collaborate with other learners during the lesson that you create a plan for in this session. For example, if you are using *Scratch* when teaching Coding, you could ask students to share their projects through *Scratch Class Studios*. The students could review and remix each others' projects that are in the *Class Studios*. You could also run an activity similar to the *Pass It On!* activity from the *Creative Computing Curriculum Guide*. In that activity, students "pass on" their projects to other students, who make their own changes to it. |
| Questioning              | You may include opportunities for your students to engage in *questioning* when completing the activities in the lesson plan that you create in the session. For example, if you are using *Micro:bits*, you may ask your students to collect data (such as measurements from the accelerometer) with the *Micro:bits* and analyse the data, as part of a scientific experiment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Inquiring – identifying, exploring and organising information and ideas | In the lesson plan that you create in this session, you may include an activity in which students have the opportunity to identify, explore and organise information and ideas. For example, you could ask your students to research a problem in the local community (from sources on the Internet) and develop a technical solution to address this problem.                                                                |
| Generating ideas, possibilities and actions                             | In the lesson plan that you create in this session, you may include an activity in which students generate a variety of different ideas, possibilites and actions, and implement these in Code. For example, you may ask students to create a *Digital Story* in *Scratch*. In the process of planning and implementing the *Digital Story*, the students will likely generate a variety of ideas, possibilities and actions. |
| Reflecting on thinking and processes                                    | In the lesson plan that you create in this session, you may include opportunities for students to reflect on their thinking and processes when Coding. For example, there are *Reflection Prompts* in many of the activities from the *Creative Computing Curriculum Guide*, which could help you get students to reflect on their thinking, as well as the processes they have taken to develop their projects.              |
| Analysing, synthesising and evaluating reasoning and procedures         | In the lesson plan you create in this session, you may include opportunities for students to analyse, synthesise and evaluate reasoning and procedures. For example, you could ask your students to explain the approaches that they have used to create projects in *Scratch*. That explanation would involve the student having to analyse, synthesise and evaluate their own reasoning and procedures when Coding.         |

| Applying social and ethical protocols and practices when using ICT | In the lesson plan that you create in this session, you may include an activity in which students have to apply social and ethical protocols. For example, you could include an acitivity in which your students remix a project in *Scratch*, in which you explain the purpose of the *remix tree* and ask students to change 10% or more of the project's contents.  |
| Investigating with ICT                                             | In the lesson plan that you create in this session, you may include an activity in which students have to investigate with ICT. For example, you could ask your students design and develop projects that could be a solution to a problem in the local community. That activity could involve researching a problem through Internet sources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Creating with ICT                                                  | In the lesson plan that you create in this session, you may include an activity in which students create a digital solution. For example, you could ask your students to create an app with *Code.org's AppLab*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Communicating with ICT                                             |  In the lesson plan that you create in this session, you may include opportunities in which students communicate with ICT. For example, you could encourage students to share their projects with the *Scratch* community and to give feedback to other students using the comments feature of *Scratch*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Managing and operating ICT                                         | In the lesson plan that you create in this session, you may include an activity in which students manage and operate ICT in a variety of ways. For example, if you use an activity involving *Micro:bits*, your students will learn how to connect the *Micro:bit* to a computer and how to run a program that is created in *Microsoft's MakeCode* on the device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
