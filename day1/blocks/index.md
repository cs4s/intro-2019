# Moving from Unplugged to Blocks Coding

## About

In this session you will learn about some websites and resources for teaching Coding with Blocks languages.
Blocks languages, which are also sometimes called *Visual Programming* languages, are commonly used when introducing learners to Coding.
For example, [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} is often used for teaching Coding in K-6 and [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (an extended version of Scratch) has been used for teaching Coding in High Schools and Universities. 
Block languages allow you drag and drop blocks to build programs, rather than typing out Code.
This means that students can focus on learning and understanding the Coding concepts, without having to worry about spelling and syntax errors at the same time.

In the last session you learned about some *'Unplugged'* approaches for teaching *Sequences* and *Loops*, which are examples of **computational concepts**.
In this session's activities, you will apply these concepts to solve Coding *puzzles*.
*Puzzles* are commonly used to help students learn and practice their Coding skills.
Some examples of *puzzles* resources, which you will learn about in this session, include: the *Lightbot* game, *Code.org's* activities and *Scratch DebugIt* projects.

In this session, you will also learn about *Events*, which are another **computational concept**, when identifying and fixing a problem in a Scratch project.

#### Computational Concepts

| Computational Concept   | How the Concept is Addressed in the Session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sequences               | When completing the *Lighbot*, *Hour of Code* and *Scratch* activities in the session, you will uses *Sequences* of commands to solve the different puzzles. For example, to complete the activities in the *Lightbot* game you will have to instruct the *Lightbot* character to take the right steps in the right order.                                                               |
| Loops                   | When completing the *Lightbot*, *Hour of Code* and *Scratch* activities in the session, you may use *Loops* to make the characters repeat actions over an over and over, in order to solve the activities' puzzles. For example, you may complete activities in *Lightbot* that involve using *Loops* to solve the puzzles and you may also learn about the *repeat* block in *Scratch*. |
| Events                  | You will learn about *Events* in the *Scratch* activity. In that activity, you will be shown an example of an *Event* block in Scratch that causes the character to follow a *Sequence* of commands when the green flag icon is clicked.                                                                                                                                                 |

#### Computational Practices

| Computational Practice          | How this Practice is Addressed in the Session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|:--------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Being incremental and iterative | When completing the *Lighbot*, *Hour of Code* and *Scratch* activities in the session, you may be *incremental* and *iterative* when solving the puzzles. This means that you may take small steps to solve the problems in these activities.                                            |
| Testing and debugging           | You will test and debug (fix problems in your Code) in the *Lightbot*, *Hour of Code* and *Scratch* activities. For example, in the *Scratch* activity you will work on a *DebugIt* activity, which involves trying to identify why a project is not working and how to fix the problem. |

| Estimating and calculating with whole numbers    | You will calculate with whole numbers when solving the puzzles in the *Lightbot*, *Hour of Code* and *Scratch* activities. For example, in the *Lightbot* activity, you will have to count the number of squares that you would like the *Lightbot* character to move, in order to light up the blue tiles. |
| Recognising and using patterns and relationships | You will recognise and use patterns and relationships when completing the *Lightbot*, *Hour of Code* and *Scratch* activities. For example, in the *Lightbot* activity you may need to recognise patterns of movements that Lightbot needs to make, in order to solve some of the harder puzzles.           |
| Using spatial reasoning                          | You will have the opportunity to use spatial reasoning when completing the *Scratch* activity. For example, you may use some of the Motion blocks in *Scratch*, which can be used to change the position of the characters on the Stage (a Cartesian plane).                                                |

For example, there are multiple ways to solve the puzzles in the *Lightbot* game, some of which involve using a smaller number of commands and are more efficient. |
| Reflecting on thinking and processes        | In the *Lightbot*, *Hour of Code* and *Scratch* activities you will have the opportunity to reflect on the approaches that you used to solve the different problems.                                                                                                                                                    |
