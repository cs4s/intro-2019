# Creative Computing with Scratch

## About

In this session you will learn about another approach for teaching Coding: through the creation of *Projects*.
[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a free Coding tool and community that is commonly used for creating Coding projects, particularly in K-6 education. The creators of [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) argue that students learning to Code should be encouraged to develop projects that are personally meaningful to them and that Coding can help students express themselves. Consequently, *Scratch* has been designed to: be easy to create projects in (*low floor*), allow for customisation and multiple solutions (*wide walls*), and be capable of handling large and complex projects (*high ceiling*).

The [Creative Computing Curriculum Guide](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/) is an example of a resource that encourages an approach to the teaching and learning coding that emphasises the creative and personally meaningful aspects of computing. 
This guide contains 7 different themed units (such as *Stories*, *Games* and *Animations*) which each contain activities, starter projects and *Debug It!* activities.
The guide has been developed for *Scratch* but some of the guide's activities could be adapted for other coding languages.

The design of the *Creative Computing Curriculum* is centred on **four main principles**:

- **Creating:** offer opportunities for learners to engage in designing and making, not just listening, observing, and using.
- **Personalising:** offer opportunities for learners to engage in activities that are personally meaningful and relevant.
- **Sharing:** offer opportunities for learners to engage in interactions with others as audience, coaches, and co-creators.
- **Reflecting:** offer opportunities for learners to review and rethink their creative practices.

[Dr Karen Brennan](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/karen-brennan){:target="_blank"} conducted research into how students and teachers used Scratch and her findings from this research also influenced the design of the *Creative Computing Curriculum Guide*. 
The main focus of Dr Brennan's research was understanding how educators (in schools and in informal learning environments, such as libraries) balanced learners' *structure* and *agency* when teaching coding with Scratch.

In this session, we will work through some of the activities in Unit 1 (*Exploring*) and Unit 2 (*Animations*) of the *Creative Computing Curriculum Guide* together.
You will also learn about another **Computational Concept** (*Parallelism*) and build on your understanding of *Sequences*, *Loops* and *Events*.
You will also have the opportunity to engage in a **Computational Practice**, when you learn about what *remixing* in Scratch is.

#### Computational Concepts

| Computational Concept   | How the Concept is Addressed in the Session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sequences               | When creating projects in *Scratch* in this session, you will create *Sequences* of instructions for a Sprite to follow. For example, in the *Getting Started* activity, you will create stacks of blocks that cause the Cat Sprite to perform different actions, such as moving around the Stage and playing a melody.                                                                                                           |
| Loops                   | When creating projects in *Scratch* in this session, you may use *Loops* to make the Sprites repeat actions over an over and over. For example, in the *10 Blocks* activity you may use the *repeat* block when moving the Cat Sprite move around the Stage.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Events                  | You will learn about a few different types of *Events* in Scratch during this session. For example, in the *10 Blocks* activity you may use the *when this sprite clicked* block, from the *Events* section, to cause the Cat Sprite move around the Stage when it is clicked. You will also practice using the *when green flag clicked* block, which can be used when *resetting* a project in *Scratch* to its original state. |
| Parallelism             | In this session, you will learn about *Parallelism* in Scratch, which is when a Sprite is (or multiple Sprites are) performing multiple actions at the same time. For example, in one of the *Debug It* activities you will have to fix a problem that involves two Sprites dancing at the same time. During the *Remixing* activity, you could also find, *remix* and modify a project, such as a game, that uses *Parallelism*. |

#### Computational Practices

| Computational Practice          | How this Practice is Addressed in the Session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|:--------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Being incremental and iterative | You will be *incremental and iterative* when creaing projects in Scratch. For example, in the *Getting Started* activity you will build up a stack of blocks iteratively (one part at a time). You may also be *iterative* when putting together blocks together during the *10 Blocks* activity.                                                                |
| Testing and debugging           | You will test and debug (fix problems in your Code) during the session's activities. For example, in the *Debug It!* activity you will identify and fix *bugs* in different *Scratch* projects.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Reusing and remixing            | You will learn about *reusing and remixing* when completing the *Remixing* activity in this session. In that activity you will take a copy of an existing *Scratch* project and make some changes to it. You will also learn about the *Backpack* feature in *Scratch*, which allows you to copy *Sprites*, *Sounds* and *Backdrops* between different projects. |

| 2.6.2: Use effective teaching strategies to integrate ICT into learning and teaching programs to make selected content relevant and meaningful | In this session you will learn about using *Scratch* when integrating ICT  into learning and teaching. For example, in the session's activities, you will learn about how to develop and remix projects in *Scratch*. Additionally, you wil learn about the *Creative Computing Curriculum Guide*, which has been designed to encourage an approach to teaching Coding that emphasises the personally relevant and meaningful aspects of Computing.                                                                |
| 3.3.2: Select and use relevant teaching strategies to develop knowledge, skills, problem solving and critical and creative thinking.           | In this session you will learn about ways to help develop students' critical and creative thinking when Coding.
