# Unplugged Approaches for Teaching Coding

## About

As you know, Computer Science (CS) is not just about Coding!
Computational Thinking and Algorithmic Thinking are at the core of CS and many of its principles can be taught without the aid of a computer. 
The activities in this session could be useful for introducing or reinforcing **computational concepts** away from a computer.
They could also be used on "rainy days", when students' computers are not working or when computer labs are not available.

In this session you will learn about some high-quality resources that could help you teach Coding concepts with an *unplugged* approach.

You will also complete some activities that will involve learning about two key **computational concepts**, which you will also apply in the rest of the sessions over the next two days.
The first of these concepts are *Sequences*, which higlight the important of being precise and correctly ordering instructions for computers to follow.
The second of these concepts are *Loops*, which refers to the way that computers can follow the same instructions over and over (or even forever!).

| Sequences               | In this session, you will use *Sequences* of instructions when completing the unplugged activities. For example, in the *My Robotic Friends* activity you will learn about the importance of creating precise and step-by-step *Sequences* that computers follow to complete a task or solve a problem.   |
| Loops                   | In this session, you will learn about using *Loops* to make a computer follow the same instructions multiple times. For example, in the *My Loopy Robotic Friends* activity you will learn about how to represent a *Loop* with particular symbols given to your partner (who will be acting as a robot). |
